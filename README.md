# humanlike-face-impressions-in-vlms
We investigate the representation of subjective face attributes within VLM embedding spaces, examining whether these representations encode human-like biases and assessing their interpretability. Using probing techniques on face datasets annotated with human judgments, we analyze the structure of VLM embeddings.
